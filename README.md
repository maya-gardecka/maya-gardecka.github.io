### About Me

Welcome!  
Witam!  
Â¡Bienvenidos!

My name is Maya (or Maja, it's one and the same!!).

I'm a software engineer, mostly working on back-end development. However, a recent work project required me to dive back into some front-end technologies.

It was slow going at first, I don't mind admitting that, but I took it as an opportunity to expand my skill set and (finally) compile a portfolio!

Website design is **not** my strong suit, so the **_look_** of each project will not be breathtaking. But it **_will_** be organized and functional.

### Projects

1.  Tech Tools

#### Tech Tools

I call this project Tech Tools because it started out as a simple text to phonetic alphabet generator for use by helpdesk employees. It's turing out to be a set of tech-adjacent tools.  
Tech stack: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
